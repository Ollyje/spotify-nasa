**<u>SPOTIFY X NASA</u>**

With this code, you can search for the fastest-tempo songs on Spotify each month and identify the fastest-moving coronal mass ejections (CMEs). A CME is an event where a large, magnetized plasma cloud erupts from the solar corona into space, causing radio and magnetic disturbances on Earth. This code draws a unique correlation between the highest energy emitted by a plasma eruption and the highest-tempo song on Spotify each month, in order to experience the speed of the solar system through sound. 

**YOU WILL NEED:**

Spotify API key (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

NASA api key (https://api.nasa.gov/)

**HOW IT WORKS**:

You will need to enter the year and month you wish to search for by changing the variables 'start_date_cme' and 'end_date_cme' and then printing 'nasa_cme' in order to print out all of the Coronal Mass Ejections from your chosen month .

You will need to use the same dates for when you search for the highest bpm songs on Spotify for the same month.
